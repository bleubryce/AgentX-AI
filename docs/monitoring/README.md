# Monitoring System

The AI Agent Platform includes a comprehensive monitoring system that tracks performance, resource usage, and system health in real-time. This guide explains how to use and configure the monitoring capabilities.

## Overview

The monitoring system provides:

- Real-time performance metrics
- System health monitoring
- Error tracking and alerting
- Resource usage monitoring
- Custom metric collection

## Components

### 1. Monitoring Service

The `MonitoringService` is the core component that handles:

- Metric collection and aggregation
- Alert generation and management
- System health checks
- Performance tracking

```typescript
import { monitoringService } from '@/services/monitoring/monitoring.service';

// Start monitoring
monitoringService.startMonitoring();

// Get performance metrics
const metrics = monitoringService.getPerformanceMetrics();

// Get system metrics
const systemMetrics = monitoringService.getSystemMetrics();

// Get recent alerts
const alerts = monitoringService.getAlerts(10);
```

### 2. Metrics

#### Performance Metrics
- Average Latency
- 95th Percentile Latency
- 99th Percentile Latency
- Error Rate
- Success Rate

#### System Metrics
- CPU Usage
- Memory Usage
- Active Connections
- Request Rate

### 3. Alerts

The system generates alerts for:
- High memory usage
- High request rates
- Error thresholds exceeded
- System performance issues

Alert types:
- WARNING: Potential issues that need attention
- ERROR: Serious issues that require immediate action
- CRITICAL: System-critical issues that need urgent intervention

## Configuration

Configure monitoring settings in `src/services/agent/agent.config.ts`:

```typescript
monitoring: {
    enabled: true,
    interval: 60000, // 1 minute
    metrics: {
        collectPerformance: true,
        collectMemory: true,
        collectErrors: true,
        memoryThreshold: 85 // Percentage
    }
}
```

## Integration with Agent Service

The monitoring system automatically integrates with the agent service to track:

- Agent execution times
- Success/failure rates
- Resource usage per agent
- Error patterns

Example:

```typescript
// Record agent execution
monitoringService.recordExecution({
    agentId: 'agent-123',
    status: ExecutionStatus.COMPLETED,
    metrics: {
        processingTime: 1500,
        memoryUsage: 256,
        apiCalls: 3
    }
});
```

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Monitoring**
   - Check system metrics regularly
   - Review performance trends
   - Monitor error rates

2. **Alert Configuration**
   - Set appropriate thresholds
   - Configure alert notifications
   - Prioritize critical alerts

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Use metrics to identify bottlenecks
   - Monitor resource usage trends
   - Optimize based on performance data

4. **Error Handling**
   - Track error patterns
   - Set up error thresholds
   - Implement automated responses

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **High Memory Usage**
   - Check for memory leaks
   - Review resource-intensive operations
   - Consider scaling resources

2. **High Error Rates**
   - Check error logs
   - Review recent changes
   - Verify external dependencies

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Monitor latency trends
   - Check system resources
   - Review concurrent operations

## API Reference

### MonitoringService Methods

```typescript
interface MonitoringService {
    startMonitoring(): void;
    stopMonitoring(): void;
    recordExecution(execution: AgentExecutionResult): void;
    getPerformanceMetrics(agentId?: string): PerformanceMetrics;
    getSystemMetrics(): SystemMetrics;
    getAlerts(limit?: number): MonitoringAlert[];
    clearMetricsBuffer(): void;
}
```

### Events

The monitoring service emits the following events:

- `monitoring:started`: When monitoring begins
- `monitoring:stopped`: When monitoring is stopped
- `execution:recorded`: When an execution is recorded
- `alert:created`: When a new alert is generated
- `health:checked`: When system health is checked
- `metrics:cleared`: When metrics buffer is cleared

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Protection**
   - Metrics data is stored securely
   - Personal information is anonymized
   - Access to monitoring data is controlled

2. **Access Control**
   - Restrict access to monitoring features
   - Implement role-based access
   - Audit monitoring access

3. **Data Retention**
   - Configure appropriate retention periods
   - Implement data cleanup policies
   - Archive historical data
