# Sales AI Features Documentation

## Overview
The Sales AI module provides intelligent sales opportunity processing and analysis through AI-powered features. This document outlines the core components, their functionality, and how to use them effectively.

## Architecture

### Core Components
1. **SalesProcessor**
   - Main processing unit for sales opportunities
   - Orchestrates AI-powered analysis and strategy generation
   - Handles metrics calculation and next steps determination

2. **SalesAIService**
   - Provides AI-powered analysis and recommendations
   - Integrates with OpenAI for intelligent processing
   - Handles competitor analysis, pricing strategies, and sales strategies

3. **SalesLogger**
   - Comprehensive logging system for monitoring and debugging
   - Supports multiple log levels (error, warn, info, debug)
   - Provides structured logging for all AI operations

## Features

### 1. Competitive Analysis
```typescript
const competitive = await salesProcessor.performCompetitiveAnalysis(opportunity);
```
- Analyzes competitor landscape
- Generates SWOT analysis
- Provides detailed competitor comparisons
- Identifies market opportunities and threats

### 2. Pricing Strategy Generation
```typescript
const pricing = await salesProcessor.generatePricingStrategy(opportunity, competitive);
```
- Recommends optimal pricing
- Determines minimum and maximum price points
- Sets discount thresholds
- Provides pricing justification
- Considers competitive factors

### 3. Sales Strategy Development
```typescript
const strategy = await salesProcessor.developSalesStrategy(opportunity, competitive, pricing);
```
- Creates customized sales approaches
- Generates key talking points
- Identifies risk factors
- Calculates success probability
- Estimates timeline
- Determines required resources

### 4. Metrics Calculation
```typescript
const metrics = salesProcessor.calculateMetrics(opportunity, strategy);
```
- Calculates opportunity score
- Determines conversion probability
- Estimates expected value
- Predicts time to close

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { SalesProcessor } from '../services/agent/processors/sales.processor';

const salesProcessor = new SalesProcessor();

const opportunity = {
    companyName: 'Tech Corp',
    contactName: 'John Doe',
    productInterest: ['AI Platform'],
    budget: 100000,
    stage: 'QUALIFICATION',
    priority: 'HIGH'
};

try {
    const result = await salesProcessor.process(opportunity);
    console.log('Analysis:', result.analysis);
    console.log('Metrics:', result.metrics);
    console.log('Next Steps:', result.nextSteps);
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Processing failed:', error);
}
```

## Error Handling and Logging

### Log Levels
- **Error**: Critical failures that need immediate attention
- **Warn**: Potential issues that don't stop processing
- **Info**: Important process milestones
- **Debug**: Detailed information for troubleshooting

### Log Files
- `logs/sales-combined.log`: Contains all log levels
- `logs/sales-error.log`: Contains only error logs

### Example Log Output
```json
{
    "level": "info",
    "message": "Competitive analysis completed",
    "opportunityId": "123",
    "competitors": 3,
    "hasStrengths": true,
    "hasWeaknesses": true,
    "timestamp": "2024-01-20T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Input Validation**
   - Always provide complete opportunity information
   - Validate budget and timeline constraints
   - Ensure proper stage classification

2. **Error Handling**
   - Implement try-catch blocks for all async operations
   - Use the logging system for error tracking
   - Handle AI service failures gracefully

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Cache market data when possible
   - Implement retry mechanisms for AI service calls
   - Monitor response times for AI operations

4. **Security**
   - Protect sensitive pricing information
   - Validate user permissions before processing
   - Secure API keys and credentials

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- AI service response times
- Error rates
- Success probability accuracy
- Pricing recommendation accuracy

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
1. Review and update competitor data
2. Validate AI model performance
3. Update pricing thresholds
4. Clean up old log files

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **AI Service Timeout**
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify API key validity
   - Implement retry logic

2. **Invalid Pricing Recommendations**
   - Verify budget constraints
   - Check market data accuracy
   - Review competitor pricing

3. **Low Success Probability**
   - Analyze opportunity qualification
   - Review competitive analysis
   - Check pricing alignment
